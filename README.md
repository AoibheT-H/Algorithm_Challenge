# Algorithm_Challenge
This is my submission for the Technical Challenge given as part of the Biomedical Engineer position. 
The algorithm, notes on the algorithm as well as outlines alternative methods can be found in the Jupyter Notebook "Aoibhe_Turner_Heaney_Algorithm_Challenge.ipynb" file.
The other files include the presentation on the algorithm ("Aoibhe_Turner_Heaney_Algorithm_Challenge_Presentation.pptx") and the radio frequency signals (signals.csv)
